# World Weather Analysis

## Overview of Project
In helping Jack with the PlanMyTrip app, weather data was collected from cities around the world.
Then that data was transformed in order to help the app users pick vacation destinations and hotels.


## Analysis
	- Generated a list of 2,000 lattitudes and longitudes
	- From that list matched them to nearest cities
	- Made API call to bring in weather info for those cities
	- Used that data to create user inputs to generate hotel and vacation destinations
	- Created a pop-up marker map visualizing those preferred hotels and destinations
	- Chose four cities and created a travel map for them
	- Created a pop-marker map for those cities
